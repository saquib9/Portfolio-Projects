# Exploring Trends in the Automotive Industry

This project involved extensive analysis of a database of car sales information to uncover insights into pricing trends, model performance, and more. The data contained details on car models, pricing history, mileage, transmission types, and other attributes.

I utilized SQL to explore the data and derive insights to guide pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies.

## Tasks Performed

1. Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the cars dataset

2. Analyzed average selling prices by various dimensions like transmission, fuel type, ownership etc. to reveal pricing patterns

3. Identified highest mileage models to understand durability and maintenance costs

4. Computed price variability within and across models to guide pricing strategy

5. Compared pricing and mileage metrics vs overall averages to find outliers

6. Generated cumulative price trends over time and YoY comparisons for price forecasting

7. Computed complex iterative analytics like moving averages for price smoothing

8. Summarized total mileage by transmission for maintenance and repair planning

9. Ranked models by selling price and analyzed historical averages for top models

10. Used SQL techniques like WINDOW functions, CTEs, JOINs for advanced analysis


This project enabled me to showcase my SQL skills to derive data-driven insights from car sales data to support key business decisions and strategies.
